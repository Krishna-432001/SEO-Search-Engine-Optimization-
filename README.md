   - Write compelling meta descriptions (up to 160 characters) with your keyword to improve click-through rates.

3. **Header Tags (H1, H2, H3):**
   - Use a single **H1 tag** for the page title and break content into sections using **H2** and **H3** tags.
   - Include relevant keywords in these headers naturally.
